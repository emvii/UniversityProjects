# Exploration of Bistability and Stochastic Influence in the Toggle Switch Gene Regulatory Circuit

## Objective
This repository contains code for analyzing the bistable behaviour in a toggle switch gene regulatory circuit under stochastic influences. When run, the code generates 14 plots detailed in the document "HCKZ5-CELL0014-REPORT".

## Requirements
The code was developed and tested in JupyterLab version 4.0.7 with Python 3.8.18. Ensure that your environment matches or is compatible with these versions.

### Dependencies
List of required packages:
- NumPy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Installation
To get the code running on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the code directory.

## Usage
To execute the code:
Open jupyterlab, then open `Toggle_Switch_Analysis.ipynb` notebook and run all cells.
