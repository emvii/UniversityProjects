# Explorations for my project: Genomic Similarities and Relationships of Oak Populations in Hainault Forest

## Objective

This repository contains code and data for analysing the genetic diversity of Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak) populations in Hainault Forest. The project examines nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes to assess genetic variation, evidence of hybridization, and the potential impact on population health and resilience. The analysis aims to provide insights into conservation strategies for these ecologically significant tree species.

the code outputs statistical analyses, PCA plots, and visualizations that highlight genetic diversity and relatedness patterns among the oak samples. Additional findings and methodology are documented in `FINAL_POSTER.pdf`.

## Requirements

The code was developed and tested in RStudio version 2023.12.1 with R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01).

### Data

This repository contains the following files necessary for successful operation of the workflow:

- `genotype-matrix-Qrob_Chr10`, containing the genotype data for chromosome 10
- `genotype-matrix-Qrob_Chr11`, containing the genotype data for chromosome 11
- `genotype-matrix-single-file`, a matrix containing the genotype data for all chromosomes across all samples.
- `samples-sheet.csv`, a csv file containing the metadata for all samples.

### Dependencies
